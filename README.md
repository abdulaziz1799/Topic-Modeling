# Topic-Modeling
Topic modeling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm was employed to extract topics. The coherence score was used to determine the optimal number of topics, with the best coherence score with four topics at 0.3328. However, coherence scores for the number of topics between 2 and 10 were very close, with no clear optimal number emerging.
